For anyone who has like, literally _ever_ interacted with me, it probably comes as no surprise that I'm a little high-strung. I expect a lot from myself, I can get a bit stressed, and sometimes that stress, or anxiety, or whatever you'd like to call it can really get the best of me.

This manifests a lot of different ways for a lot of different people, but for me I feel like I always just start to feel... heavy. Who knows what causes it -- maybe it's hormones, maybe it's external factors, maybe it's that I usually don't even realize I'm stressed out until I get to this point because FOMO IS REAL, FOLKS. When I feel like this, I don't want to do much of anything but mindlessly consume. Not consume anything worthwhile, I'm talking about scrolling past your new profile picture for the twentieth time, or reading an AskReddit thread I don't care about. 

It takes a concerted effort to get out of this heaviness, but I've found a few things that work. I don't know if this list is for you, or for me to remember next time ordering a pizza, pouring a glass of wine, and blindly scrolling Reddit sounds like the most appealing thing in the world. Because -- spoiler -- it's never the most appealing thing in the world.

<b>1. Get Outside.</b> This is a big one for me. I love the outdoors, but sometimes, even when I'm feeling my best, it feels like a lot of work. This is where something small comes in. Getting outdoors doesn't mean "figuring out where to rent a paddleboard, how to transfer a paddleboard, and exploring lakes unknown," for me sometimes it means "reading a book on your patio." I'm actually typing this on my patio right now. It smells like cow manure, but I'm out here. Why? I don't know. I don't live near cows. I live near a Chick-Fil-A.

<b>2. Make a To-Do List</b> Oh man. This. When everything you need and want to do just feels incredibly overwhelming, sit down and write it all out. I use different "checkboxes" to indicate whether a task is personal, professional, or academic. Half a slash means it's in progress, an 'X' means it's done. Don't underestimate the power of this system when you feel like you're in full on "put one foot in front of the other" mode. 

<b>3. Check Your Water Intake</b> Like, for real -- "drink wine" is not going to be on my list of ways to deal with stress, because while realistic at times, that's uh... not the healthy way to deal with things. Drinking water, however, is. If I'm feeling really stressed out and can't put my finger on any real reason why, there's a good chance I haven't been getting much water. Drink water so your body doesn't freak out.

<b>4. Whatcha Eatin?</b> I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do a Whole 30 and figure out through elimination that your bagels are making you question all your life choices. (Honestly, I don't buy into that, and you should Google who wholly unqualified the people who came up with Whole 30 are to tell you about much of anything. Sorry, tangent done.) For me, it's pretty simple -- are you getting enough fruits and veggies, or are you pretending like Raising Canes is going to boost your mood? Option B does not work. Not even at 3am and you already know 10am you is going to regret all your life choices. My outlook on life is easily 110% brighter when there's enough broccoli on my plate -- seriously. I also am known to get kind of queasy when I'm stressed, so eating well keeps that to a minimum. 

<b>5. Work Out</b> This really shouldn't be this low on my list, because this is a biggie for me. My brain is basically a puppy -- I need to wear both it and my body out to get it to calm the hell down for thirty minutes. Everyone touts the mental effects of exercise, and it's so true if you're someone that feels overwhelmed. The best kind of workouts for me are ones that are literally so hard that my brain has no choice but to stfu and just start counting down seconds until it's over. It's like meditation, for people that are too non-stop to meditate. 

Those are my big ones. There are some things I've been trying to get better at -- particularly meditation -- but, sometimes I can self-sabotage. I know something will be good for me, but it can be just hard to drag yourself to do it. I was having one of those nights, which is why I decided to write this post -- at least this is doing something. 

On that note, a cicada or something huge just dropped next to me. Maybe strike number one off the list.

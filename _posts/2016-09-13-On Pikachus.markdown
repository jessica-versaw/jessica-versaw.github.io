Sorry, this is SO not a post on Pokemon Go.

I got bored of that after like, ten minutes. It doesn't help that Pokemon are not enough to motivate me to stop what I'm doing and trot around trying to find them. There was that viral video of the mom finding wine that I could get behind, however. 

ANYWAY.

We're talking more the Chelsea Handler before she got annoying definition of Pikachu. First, I'm alive! Here's a picture of my sassily posing at one of my two weddings this weekend to prove it.

*As Beyonce said, I did not come to play with you hoes. Except you're not hoes, you're great.*

I'm feeling a hell of a lot better. I'll spare you the details (unless I find Wine Go, then maybe not), but I'm no longer a. in an obscene amount of pain b. embarassed to be seen in public c. wondering if I'll ever be normal again. I have, however, talked more about my lady bits to more people than I ever care to again. It's amazing how transparant you become about things, though. At the beginning, I tried quite hard to play it off as a knee injury, but it became kind of clear everyone was going to know I was full of shit, my knee was fine, and I'd look sketchy as hell. So, oversharing honesty it is.

But, now I'm back in the office, back socializing, and as of yesterday, back at the gym as well. I've learned a couple things. 

1. It is really hard to get things done when you can't get out of your bed. 
2. I feel really unaccomplished and depressed when I can't get things done.
3. I am one of the worst patients in the world. Ryan was regularly telling me I really needed to slow down and not keep trying to push my limits. I don't know why he didn't understand that the fridge needed to be cleaned out RIGHT NOW. 
4. And the most serious one... The way people look at your when you're obviously not at 100% makes you really, really self-concious. During the worst of it, I'd try to go out on short excursions, mainly for my sanity's sake (and maybe my marriage's when it came to the grocery store). I'd use the stupid scooter thing -- which likes to stop working every 2-5 minutes, by the way -- and the way people looked at me felt pretty terrible. I'm not sure if it was because by all means I appeared to them like a perfectly healthy 20-something, and they thought I was using the cart as a joke, or if it was just a bit of a sense of curiosity, but for the love, it sucked. 

It wasn't much better any time I tried to limp around, it almost felt like I made other people uncomfortable just by trying to hobble my way around in the same vicinity as them. Which was crappy. I wasn't aiming to make other people uncomfortable, or draw any attention to myself at all. I just wanted to feel moderately self sufficient and get the hell out of my house. 

That being said, people absolutely were not all bad, and I recognize that the people in the above point weren't malicious at all. It's just something I've never had to deal with. A huge amount of people have asked how I'm feeling. (Or "How's your.... yeah. Are you better?" That's been a common one.) There have been some I had no idea knew anything about the fact that I was hurt. I think a pretty cute story is that I went to a wedding of two great friends, Scout and Daniel, this weekend. We played in a kickball league this past autumn, and her parents would come out to every game -- her family was pretty worried about whether or not I'd be able to climb up the stairs to get to my assigned table. Luckily I was pretty much back to normal by then, and was probably hurting more from another great pair of friends, Bailey and Nick's, wedding the night before than anything else. I rallied. I ate awesome food truck food and sang along to Backstreet Boys and danced with the best of them.

*I ate my weight in wood fired pizza and I am not ashamed.*

My in laws sent me an edible arrangement (the chocolate covered pineapple literally didn't make it five minutes, I'm completely obsessed). My friend Jordan brought my a bagel and sat and hang out during the Saturday morning of the first game when Ryan had to work and I was sad about missing gameday festivities. I am 99.9% certain this is why my mom bought me a pair of boots I was lusting over. My friends Meaghan and Erin put up with way too many, way too detailed updates. (And many others, but they definitely got it the worst.) My grandmother sent me an American Eagle gift card. 

Speaking of American Eagle, did you know they've shifted their target market to 20-somethings? I guess teens today are way too into Forever 21, Zara, and other fast fashion companies that make their money ripping other people off, so they've decided to go back to the age group that grew up with them. They've got some pretty kickass stuff right now, I highly suggest you check them out. Their bralettes are just ace.

Everyone at work was very understanding, and has been great about my doctor's appointments, generally crappy schedule, and taking meetings from bed. Which always made me feel like a complete weirdo. I bought a lap desk so I could be kind of official, at least. The two other women on my squad, Kelsey and Lauren, are empathy extrodinnaires, and were great to slack with when I was feeling generally down. 

The owner of my gym sent me an e-mail asking where I was and what was going on. This is going to tie into it's own post, so more on that later. 

So, all in all... I've largely picked up my life where I left off. Thanks, everyone. I promise to never use the phrase "lady bits" on this thing ever again.

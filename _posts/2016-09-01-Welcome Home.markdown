So, the rest of Europe was pretty great -- we went to Nice, which was gorgeous, and basically ended the vacation the way any adventure-packed two week vacation should end -- with a decent amount of beach and nothing. I think my final book talley was 6. 

Friday, we visited Oxford, which was a little melancholic for me -- it really drives home that for the life you live to thrive, you kill off a thousend other tiny storylines that could have been your life. Returning to Oxford definitely reminded me of that. Maybe I'll go into that more on another post, but I have another reason to feel bad for myself right now, and I'm going to focus on that. 

Friday, I slipped and fell, and have what's called a "straddle injury" -- yes, it's what it sounds like, no, don't Google it. 

So, yeah. I didn't know you could injure yourself this severly from a simple fall. I'm on day 5? I don't know, they're all blending together... of bed rest. I can walk for about five minutes at a time before the pain gets overwhelming -- so enough to not be entirely helpless, but not enough to not be wildly frustrated. 

It's a pretty big downer for me on a lot of levels. I was looking forward to getting back in my routine -- spin class or barre in the morning, work through the day, come home and make something with vegetables in at night (I did...not eat a lot of vegetables during the month of August). Sunday, I was ecstatic about going to the Old Cheney Farmer's Market (way better than Haymarket Farmer's Market), getting my produce for the week, maybe eating one last not-so-healthy meal from the wood fired pizza stand, and getting unpacked and my house back in order. 

Instead, I got to go to the ER! You know what's fun? When an ER doctor looks at your injury and goes "Oh...wow. I mean, I guess that's what I expected, but... wow. Let me write you a perscription for a stronger painkiller." So, yeah. There's really nothing they can do, they just told me to apply heat and wait. 

Needless to say, laundry isn't done, unpacking is completed about as much as I can do in five minute intervals/from bed, and I am losing my damn mind. Ryan has, of course, been very helpful -- he's cooked dinner the last few nights, which is not his favorite duty, to say the least; and he's been pretty patient with my demands for various housework tasks to be done because the sink full of dirty dishes was driving me insane. 

Work has, of course, been understanding as well. I was really hoping I could be back in office at the end of the week, but that's definitely not going to happen. I did get a lapdesk, though, so I feel very official working from my bed. 

I guess I can see how having a long term disability must be really, really, mentally challenging, and I'm trying to remember that this is only temporary and there are those that have it far worse. But man, is being stuck in your bed isolating (even my cats seem bored of me as of today, and are off doing their own thing), and frustrating, and disheartening. Recovery is proving slower than I excpected, and it's really starting to take a mental toll. The most unhealthy I ever get is something that lasts a few days, at most -- needing a root canal, or having a cold or food poisoning or the like. I think there's also a double insult in that mentally, and for the most part physically, I feel fine -- I'm not weak, I'm not tired. I can get a little nauseous from the pain at times, but that's about it. Also, people get really sick about hearing you whine about something they can't change, so I feel like I mostly just need to suck it up. (Which I guess is why I'm writing this, because if you're sick of it, you can just stop reading. You don't have to feign sympathy like if I'm talking to you one on one.)

So, yeah. There's your whiny blog post. I'll take personality types that don't handle being bedridden well for 100, Alex.

I wrote this blog post a few weeks ago. Now that SNL did a pretty great sketch that sums up these feelings in a fun way, I feel like I can finally post it. 

Consent is obviously a pretty hot topic lately. It should’ve been a hot topic, like, for all of time, but whatever, we’re here now. Which is good. I guess.

I feel like I can’t be alone in that I’ve basically been screaming internally for weeks at just how shocked everyone seems. Like oh, you haven’t noticed a deep seated problem before this? The problem that made it okay for a guy to reach under my dress and grab me while I was dancing a few years ago? Or last spring when a guy rode by on a bike and smacked me on the butt? Or in college when a doctor played with my belly button ring and called it “cute” in the middle of yearly women’s exam? Or last weekend when a guy hit my ass when I was just trying to get a gyro, thankyouverymuch?

Every. Single. Woman. Has. These. Stories.

My responses, in order, were: 

Punch in the face and get the guy kicked out of the bar (he called me a bitch and insisted I should be the one kicked out, thank God for a bouncer that had my back when I explained what happened).
Was too shocked (and likely, a bit scared) to do much of anything except write a raging Facebook post later
Uh… nothing except specifically ask to not see that doctor any longer. I was like, 20, and convinced myself he didn’t mean anything by it.
Said “Are you fucking serious,” but not much else, because really what was I going to do? I didn’t get the gyro, btw.

These are just a snapshot of the countless times someone has done something inappropriate to me without my consent. And if you want to know how deep-rooted this problem is, take this into account -- when these allegations first started to blow up, I told my husband I felt a little weird speaking up about it because, you know, it’s not like I’d been raped, or sexually assaulted, or anything. I know others who’ve had it so much worse. He looked up incredulously and just said “you’ve had your vagina grabbed at a bar and don’t think you’ve been sexually assaulted?”

Uh, fair.

So -- I guess I’m glad we’re finally taking these things seriously. I guess I’m glad that I no longer feel like I have to tell myself what happened “wasn’t that big of a deal.”

But I only guess. Because I’m still waiting to see what happens systemically, after the movements have cooled. Is this going to lead to long term changes? 

I sure hope so.

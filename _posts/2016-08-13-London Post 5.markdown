## London, Days 9-13

Sunday. The London socialization marathon continues. 

We slept fairly late, and woke up in time to shower and such to make our brunch reservation with Olga & Hannah at 1:30. We ate at the Paternoster Chophouse, which is apparently where some British dating reality show is filmed -- but more importantly, has "free-flowing prosecco." I was a little amused to find that's how bottomless brunches were described throughout the city, as it sounds a lot classier than "bottomless mimosas." Our food was a bit slow, but we didn't much mind as the "free-flowing" aspect of the prosecco lasted from when you ordered to when you completed your main. The fact that I'm also the slowest eater in the world came in handy here, as well. 

After the brunch, we made our way to Hyde park to do as the locals -- sit with a bottle of cider and read and lounge about in the sun. We also walked down the Prince Albert Flower Walk, which was quite pretty. We stayed there until it started to get dark, then had some non-exceptional Chinese before heading home. 

Monday up until now has been largely uneventful -- we've been working, trying to desperately tie up all the loose ends that only become obvious when you're about to take a two week break, and have gone out to eat each night. On Monday, we just popped into a pub that served pies that sounded nice (i ordered one with chicken, leeks, and thyme). I probably shouldn't have looked up the calories _after_ I had already shoved it in my mouth hole, as I have felt really pouty about the 2,300+ calories I inhaled that evening ever since. On the bright side, the pub was pretty interesting -- there was evidence there has been a pub on that site since 1415. Also, since our caloric intake was already shot to hell anyway, we decided to try Udderlicious, the ice cream shop that had been catching my eye when we walked by it each morning to get into work. Ryan and I got a bit starstruck by all the flavours (ha), and wound up ordering two scoops each, when we really needed...well, none.

Tuesday, we met up with Cathi and Laura at Pachamama, a Peruvian tapas-style restaurant. I'd never had Peruvian, but Lord knows I love anything tapas style. It didn't disappoint -- I think my favorite was crispy lamb belly, which is a bit odd considering I mostly don't like lamb. It was great to catch up with Cathi and Laura, and hear that honestly, their lives in London don't sound much different than mine in Lincoln. If there has been a theme for the week, it's been that it's really becoming clear that no matter where you live, you start to settle into your routines and there doesn't seem to be much variance -- but I have a whole blog post about that realization coming, once I've caught everyone up with the day to day.

Wednesday, I finally got to try a spin studio in London, which had been on my to-do list but kept getting shoved off. I went to Psycle, and it was pretty similar to Fly back home, except my spin instructors don't usually spend 45 minutes shouting "GORGEOUS" at me in a British accent. But I kind of wish they would... if for nothing else, the entertainment value. The studio itself was cool, and I really enjoyed the lighting in the studio -- hard to explain, but it had bars running across the ceiling that could have their colors changed, and kind of had the effect of a lazer light show. I'm a sucker for those little touches. I was surprised there were only two boutique spin studios in London, but our coworker, Michael, explained over dinner the next evening that since space is at such a premium, those kind of things are a bit slow to catch on, and larger, chain gyms rule. I have to say, I wouldn't much like having no real option other than a Planet Fitness or Golds Gym (or whatever the Golds in Lincoln is now, it seems it changes twice a year). I love having my smaller studio, where I know a lot of the people and chat as we're getting ready, or who notice when I haven't been around in awhile. 

Wednesday evening, we had dinner with our coworker, Michael, at a nice Italian place by our office, as Ryan has been craving pasta ever since we walked in on the guy who owns our Airbnb eating pasta with pesto. We leave INCREDIBLY early tomorrow morning, so we spent much of the rest of the night trying to get everything sorted out in order to be ready to go when we return from seeing Kinky Boots on the West End the next evening.

On Thursday, we intended to take the morning off. Thinking we were going to step away from work the day before we left for two weeks, however, was... well, really stupid. We woke up a bit later than intended, and needed to get a suitcase to the office to keep there while we went about on budget airlines that price guage the hell out of you for two weeks. (MORE ON THAT LATER. A LOT MORE.) By the time we were due to make it in, I felt stressed enough about trying to tie a bow on all my current projects that I really just wanted to work for a bit. We decided we would head to the Museum of London for a few hours around the lunch hour instead, as Ryan had some meetings he wanted to attend at the end of the day. Ultimately, though, it wound up being a wash, and we just worked through the day -- it's not as if we'll never return to London. After, we met up with another cheerleading friend of mine, Ben, to see Kinky Boots. 

Oh. My. God. 

It was amazing. I wasn't really sure what to expect -- Ryan and I have seen the film and enjoyed it, and it won quite a few awards, but it was one of the cheaper West End shows. It was delightful, there's really no other word to describe it. We also had more th√ün a little wine (and a champagne ice pop), and wrapped up the evening at Pizza Express because humans gotta eat. We sat and talked until Ben missed multiple trains, and Ryan and I would get hardly any sleep before we had to wake up at 4am to make our flight. Whoops. (Worth it.)

Well, that's it. The last London post for a few weeks -- I actually wrote a decent chunk of this the other day and forgot to post it, so now I'm cleaning it up and adding on and such, and posting from Madrid. Where we couldn't figure out why our hotel room smelled like sweat until I realized the spin clothes I brought with me (we'll have a washer at our next Airbnb) were hanging out open on the floor. Ha, guess ~~I'm really disgusting~~ it was actuallly a good class. After this post, I'll be done with working until the 29th, so I'm hoping I'll have a bit more time to blog something other than just a play by play of a group of days.

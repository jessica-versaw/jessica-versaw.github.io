I'm going to try to be a bit better about taking photos going forward, so these are less a wall of text. I also need to take the time to sort out resizing and adding captions, but ain't nobody got time for that right now.

London, Days Three through Five (Or, Working in London)

Monday was the first day we worked in the London office. We met Mihai, and took off around 9:30. It's about a five minute walk to the tube station, 10 minutes on the tube, and a 15 minute walk into the office. We're staying in far north London, in an area called Tottenham Hale. It's nothing overwhelmingly interesting, a lot of it is quite a bit newer so it feels more like any other city than London. The housing development our flat is in is a bit interesting though, in that it houses standard people who would own/rent a flat, low income individuals in subsidized housing, and some housing for the mentally ill.

The area that surrounds the office is quite nice -- so many restaurants you don't know what to do with, and a good many shops that I haven't gotten much of a chance to explore yet. It's a bit weird to get into work as late as everyone in the London office does -- most everyone starts and leaves fairly late, to have as much overlap with the Lincoln office as possible, so we've been getting in around 10 and leaving around 6:30-7pm. The first two days that wasn't too tough, as it was pretty miserable -- fairly chilly and raining. But yesterday was quite nice out, and today looks like it's shaping up to be as well. The building the office is in is interesting, as it was originally built in 1862 as a Royal Agricultural Hall.

#A few thoughts on working out of the London office#
-There is a ton more natural light, which really seems to help my motivation. The Lincoln office is always fairly dark (at least my part of it), and I have a much easier time staying focused and energized when I'm sitting by a window with natural light.
-It's really interesting to hear different languages being spoken throughout the office. The office is pretty multicultural, and hearing a few people standing around waiting for tea speaking Spanish is a cool experience.
-THEY HAVE TEA. The Lincoln office only has coffee, which I very, very rarely drink. I'm in caffeine heaven with multiple flavors of green tea, and black tea (with milk on hand).
-Finding a meeting room is a cake walk until 2pm, but after that? Good luck. 2pm in London is 8am in Lincoln, so that's meeting time. It doesn't help that I forgot to bring headphones with a speaker, so I _have_ to go to a meeting room vs. taking my standup at my desk. 
-People are a lot less picky about provided lunches, and more open to trying things that would NEVER fly at headquarters. I can promise you people would absolutely lose their shit if we brought in curry for lunch.
-The time difference is more impactful than I expected it to be. I kind of enjoy having the hours in the morning where I can just grind on testing without worrying about meetings or anything of the like, but I feel bad for the developers on my team, because they're getting absolutely bombarded with questions the second they come online -- so it's basically like "Good morning, hope you had your coffee, because I've been sitting on these twenty questions for five hours now."
-Because lunch isn't provided, they have loads of snacks available. The double chocolate biscuits are getting me in trouble.

#London Lunches#
Oh man -- London lunches are wonderful. The only day lunch is provided by Hudl is Wednesday, and everyone votes on what they'd like brought in, and then orders specifically what they want -- it's like my early days at Hudl. Obviously not something you can swing in an office of 200 people, but it's a nice touch of nostalgia. 

On days where lunch isn't provided, groups go to one of the million restaurants within five minutes of the office. On Monday, we went to Chilango, which is effectively a Chipotle-style burrito joint. I got...well, pretty much what I get at chipotle, a steak burrito with veg. When asked which salsa I wanted, I obviously said spicy -- and wasn't expecting much, because... England. I wound up having to slink back downstairs to the counter for water. It wasn't too spicy to eat, but too spicy to eat without some water, for certain. 

On Tuesday, we had my favorite lunch thus far -- this little asian takeaway type restaurant called Itsu. I got a Thai Chicken Brown Rice Bowl, and guys... I need to figure out how to recreate this at home. Fresh spinach, green onions and peas, with well seasoned chicken over rice and all topped with a creamy coconut milk sauce. I'm still dreaming of this. 

Wednesday, lunch was brought in -- it was a Vietnamese Hot Box. It was fine -- still much better than most of the lunch at HQ, if just for the interesting factor -- but my beef was fatty enough that it made the meal not quite as exciting. Still, not going to complain about a free lunch, particularly in London. 

#Weekday Evenings#
Can't say we've been doing anything too crazy in the evenings, and we don't really have an opportunity to do much of anything touristy, as most museums and such close at 6pm. On Monday, we got Pho with a couple of the guys from the office, then headed home and hit the bed. We both fell asleep fairly fast, then woke up from about midnight until 2am. Jet lag is a bitch. 

Tuesday, Ryan and I walked down to Exmouth Market, which is a little street lined with cafes about 15 minutes walk from the office. The weather was _fine_, but still not great, so I doubt we really got the full experience there. We wound up eating at a restaurant called Pizza Pilgrim, which was tiny (We actually shared the 6 person high top table with another American couple, who was... odd, to say the least. 99% certain the woman was on drugs.), but delicious. We got a pizza with sausage, broccolini, chili, and mozzerella. They had a chili oil you could use to spice things up a bit, so obviously my slices were doused in that. I'm glad most of the time the option for adding spice does not involve oil, unless I'd probably be huge. We finished with a nutella and salted ricotta pizza ring, which was obviously stupid good. Ryan also headed back to Exmouth to get a haircut at "Barber Streisand," which is a name I get a huge kick out of.

On Wednesdays, Hudl has a team that plays 5 a side football (soccer), so we ventured over to Shoreditch to watch them play. It was kind of interesting -- there were a ton of these pretty small pitches, with netting surrounding them (even the top). The Hudl team destroyed the team they were up against 20-0 -- by the end the goalkeeper on the other team looked pretty damn defeated. I'm half afraid he went home and questioned what he was doing with his life before crying himself to sleep.

After that, we went over to Box Park, which is pretty interesting -- it's a bunch of old shipping containers stacked together to create a bunch of little stores and restaurants. Shoreditch was explained to me as "the Brooklyn of London," and yeah... they nailed it. You knew you were in Shoreditch based on how people were dressed and coiffed. Suffice it to say, I felt patently uncool. I wound up walking around the restaurant area probably about six times before landing on a burger with cheese, chimchurri, and I can't even remember what else. I also got a couple good cocktails -- one called a Sista Nancy that involved strawberry, basil, gin, and lemonade (Sprite), another called a Hoo Doo Voo Doo (Say that ten times fast). People were playing beer pong, which I... didn't really realize was a thing outside of U.S. college parties. I can't even tell you the last time _I_ played (though slap cup is a bit of a different story).

We wound up closing down Box Park with Peter and Andrew -- though it wasn't too difficult, considering it closed at 11pm. So, definitely not the same thing as closing down bars on a weekday in Lincoln. Since this was our first time in Shoreditch, we weren't entirely certain how to get home, but luckily we both carry tiny computers in our pocket that could tell us -- mostly. We were being pointed to a National Rail train (vs. the Underground, which we're both pretty familiar with at this point), so we boarded that despite it being pretty damn deserted. What we didn't realize is it wouldn't be another twenty minutes until we left the , during which Ryan is questioning my navigation skills more and more (and therefore making me question my navigation skills more and more). Finally the train took off, and I somewhat nervously waited to make sure we were heading to the right place. We were, so I got to gloat at the end, and we made it home and turned in.

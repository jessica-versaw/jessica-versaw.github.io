This blog is probably going to be ugly until I get back to the States, as I doubt I'll have time to put a theme in place. But I know there are just loads of you starving for more information about my time abroad (...Or just my family, it's fine.), so I figured I'd use my blog to keep tabs on things. 

##London, Day -3

The trip _ahem_ -- excitement -- began earlier, when I noticed the left side of my jaw was a bit sore. I'd gotten a root canal on that side a year ago (I got to live with that pain on my first wedding anniversary, it was great.), but recently I had noticed the base of that tooth was a bit sore again, and was trying to floss it away. The Tuesday before we left, it got a bit worse. So I said a few curse words and called the dentist. The pulled up the x-ray, and I could tell by the hygenist's reaction that I was going to need another root canal in that tooth, which is APPARENTLY A THING. So the dentist came and confirmed my suspicisons... oh, and it needs to be done before you leave. In 48 hours. 

More curse words, lots of calling and having very sympathetic sounding receptionists tell me there's nothing they can do for me. Finally I found an endodondist in Omaha who could do a root canal on short notice, so cue the first time that week that we'd have to drop everything and get up to Omaha ASAP. On the bright side, the sedatives they gave me definitely worked... the rest of the day is a bit of blur, most of which I slept through. 

##London, Day -2

Hey, you get kind of a hungover from a sedative that works that well combined with vicodin. Who would have thought? Also, my mouth hurt.

##London, Day -1

We spent the morning frantically getting the house ready to leave for a month, with a few meetings sprinkled in. I had just received my replacement phone, so I was trying to get that set up so I could send my old one back to insurance. A few heart attacks over that later, we were good to go, and ready to lfly out of the Lincoln airport at 2:45. Then I checked my email, which I had just re-synced to my phone. Flight cancelled, rebooked for 6:15. We'd now get into London at 11:30am vs. 8:30am, so not that huge of a deal. We re-arranged our rides and hung out until we'd need to catch the next flight. However, it wasn't long until we needed to scramble again -- our second flight had been cancelled. I called United, got a little sassy, and got a flight out of Omaha. Except we had to leave... like, twenty minutes ago. I got Claire on the line, and she raced to our house to dart us up to Omaha. Our flight changed about four times during the drive up, but things were looking promising. 

We got up there, and had to wait a bit to check in -- nearly everyone was impacted by the Chicago delays, and nearly everyone was _pissed_. We checked in, and the woman at the counter (who we kept a sharp eye on, as someone at the United counter had LOST a friend's PASSPORT a week or so earlier, trapping them in the country) was in the middle of checking us in when she goes "Oh, NOW they want to board? You guys better get up there fast." The flight we had gotten booked on was set to depart at 6:45pm, but had been delayed since 1:15pm. so really they could leave ~whenever the hell they wanted~ whenever Chicago was ready for them. We hightailed it up there, I found out that if they have to rebook your flight they strip your TSA precheck (Thanks!), but ultimately we made it. Ultimately, it was good that they pushed the flight up, as it gave us a bit more leeway in Chicago, though our flights wound up being 7 gates apart. 

Our flight to London was largely uneventful -- we watched _Hail, Caeser!_ (mediocre), I drank some red wine (also mediocre), and slept a bit (really mediocre, Ryan makes a shit pillow.).

As this post is already quite long, this seems like a good stopping point -- stay turned for London, Day 1 soon.

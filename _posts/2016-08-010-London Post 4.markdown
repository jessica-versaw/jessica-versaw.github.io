Sorry, it's been a bit -- considering we hadn't even seen the other person who _lives_ in the flat we're staying in until last evening, it's easy to see how the time for blogging would be sparse at best. So, weekend dump of information incoming.

## London, Days 6 & 7 

So the context doesn't get lost, this is Thursday August 4th and Friday August 5th. Thursday was largely uneventful -- worked a full day, the only _truly_ notable aspect was my first cheeky Nandos. 

 After work, a good group of people opted to go to a pub that lined up against the canal in the neighborhood our office is it. It was filled with long boats that people would live in -- I'd be curious as to the cost of doing so. They certainly weren't tall enough to stand up in them, and the people lounging on top seemed that free-spirited bohemian type of person I've always secretly wished I could be. I think it surprises no one to hear that I probably won't sell all my wordly posessions and see Europe via a boat I can't be upright in any time soon. Especially those that know how motion sick I get. One did have a cat that looked like Cecily sitting on it, which my coworker Peter was quick to point out to me. Because of course he had already been shown pictures of my cats -- he also had a tortoiseshell cat, and named it Marmite, which is a wonderful name for a cat with that coat.

We walked along the canal for a bit, and it was pretty narrow -- particularly when going under bridges. A few of our coworkers told us they often see bikers topple into the canal, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't slightly interested in seeing that happen (it didn't, which is probably good for the bikers -- the canal did not look like something I'd like to take a dip in). After a few pints of cider at the pub, a few up us went to a burger joint called Meat Liquor. It took me seeing the name written out to finally grasp what everyone has been calling it, which is kind of fair... it's not as if the name makes much sense. I ordered a drink called a Sex Show Sour (because it sounded good), which was served with a ping pong ball. If you don't know why, I would absolutely suggest you refrain from googling it. The food was pretty damn good, though the popularity of burger joints in London is a bit over the top.

Friday was one of our first days of the more touristy ish. We took the morning off to visit the Tower of London. I've been before, but it had been years, and Ryan has never been. It was, if I do say so myself, a brilliant move on our part to go on a weekday morning -- we waltzed right into the crown jewels. By the time we left, the queue to get in was huge. It's always interesting to see the crown jewels -- I feel this combo of jealousy and wonder at the fact that one of those objects is likely worth more than my entire life's work will be, and it's merely because who you were born to. Not that it's really all that different now that we've largely left royalty behind, we just pretend it is. We also visited the White Tower, which I believe was closed for restoration last time I was there, which was a pleasent surprise. It was largely a lot of weapons (meh), but interesting none the less. As with most historical exhbibits in England, the amount of content and attention to detail is just insane.

Friday evening we went out with a group of Hudlies, and I met up with my friend from Oxford Cheer, Olga. It's amazing to me how quickly six years seems to go by anymore -- the period from when I was 12 to 18 drug on forever, but the past six years have absolutely flown past, and I pretty regularly seem to pick up largely where we left off with old friend. Which in this case, meant Olga was keeping the Prosecco in my glass topped off regularly. We went to a few places in Shoreditch before calling it a night (but not before I facetimed with Erin, which was basically the theme of the weekend).

## London, Days 8 and 9

Saturday morning I was up like a shot at 7:30am, because my body apparently is ridiculous. I showered and puttered about for a few hours while waiting for Ryan to wake, but ultimately wound up falling back asleep a bit more, until 11:30. And by "putter around" I mean "scoured yelp for my best full English breakfast option." I settled on Cafe 338, which was in Bethnal Green -- in no small part because I could add Halluomi to my full breakfast, AS IF A FULL ENGLISH BREAFAST COULD GET ~~FATTIER~~ BETTER.

Everyday, but magically without gaining weight, please and thanks. 

After destroying that, we made our way to the Churchill War Rooms, which is something that had been on my to-do list for years. It was really interesting, and there was an insane amount of content that really gave an amazing picture of just how much the war rooms ran on this sort of methodical image of calm. Churchill sounds like kind of an ass (he hated noise, and imported in special noiseless typewriters for his staff), but the kind of ass you need to get a nearly impossible job done. I'm glad we went, though it was quite a beautiful day to spend in a bunker. 

Surprisingly, going to the war rooms was the first time I'd been around Westminister. Though we didn't get to do any tours, seeing the Palace of Westminister up close was just mind boggling. The level of detail in those buildings is just insane, and I took as many pictures as humanly possible against the huge tide of people going through the area. This was the most touritsty area we'd been, and you can definitely feel the undercurrent of nervousness that's gripping the city in the wake of Nice, Belgium, Paris... yeah, I'll stop depressing you. But between talking to people who live here, and the sheer volume of police (including armed police) present at Westminister, it's pretty clear everyone is a bit on edge, and a little cautious. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think of the tube bombings at times -- though I am getting the opportunity to read a lot more than usual (amazing how much you can get through when you get to spend your commute reading), and that takes your mind off of it.

Seriously, the detail is ridiculous.

Right -- back to the fun things. After we finished at the war rooms, we went to a Midnight Apothocary Cocktail Popup to meet up with Joan and Adriana (with special guest appearences by my two friends from cheer, Cathi and Laura). This popuup was phenomenal -- it was set in this little garden, and all the cocktails had botanical elements (they called them botanitails) that were grown in the garden. It was like something out of some fairy land.

I'd say they're too pretty to drink, but you know me better than that. 

After a botanital (or two), a man I can only describe as "quentissential batty old English guy" stood up, and told us it was time for the highlight of the evening, the grand tour. No one seemed to know was was going on, but off we went like little gin soaked lemmings following him down this tunnel. We went down the tunnel, which was largely dark, save for some purpole lighting, photos playing through on the wall, and a water-like light cast on the floor. A man (shirt fully unbuttoned and askew) was pounding at the piano randomly, then stops and heads upstairs, singing as he goes. It turns out, the structure we were imbibing on was the entrance to the first tunnel to run under a river anywhere in the world -- the older guy had brough us into a portion of it, and regaled us with the history and engineering that went into getting a tunnel under the Thames. It turned out to be quite interesting, especially considered I'd frequently used underwater tunnels in Virginia, and how they were built was always that thought that would flit through my mind, but leave before I could get the chance to Google it.

Terrible photo, but captures some of the element of "What the hell is happening?" 

After we wrapped up at the pop up, we walked along the river and landed at a pub that had access to a terrace-type space with a view of Tower Bridge. We grapped a drink for the pub, and sat along the walls of the terrace to chat and watch the sun set. Quite a few of Joan and Adriana's friends had joined us at this point, as well as Antonios and Tatiana -- so we were quite the group. After the sun went down, we came to the collective decision that food was probably a good call, and made our way to Franco Manca, a very popular pizza joint. It was phenomenal -- italian style, fresh ingredients, and more of that chili oil.

The pub had a very short door. Husband for scale. 

After that I was getting quite tired thanks to a heavier Friday, but we still managed to make it to a gin bar with the rest of the group. I thought it was odd all the bartenders were men, but apparently that's a bit of a thing for cocktail bars around here. After I had my first gin drink (Ryan opted for cider -- not much of a gin fan), we realized it was 1am and it would take us an hour to get back home, so we decided we should head back. We sat at a bus stop waiting for the night bus (and with me seriously regretting not bringing a cardigan) for about 20 minutes before we just gave up and got an uber. 

So that takes you up through the end of the week -- I'll have a post catching up again soon, but may take a break to wax poetic about London vs. Lincoln, how dining out feels different abroad, and being in my late 20s as a whole.

Ohh look, this one has pictures. Side note -- you'll have to forgive me. I'm using Sublime Text and Markdown to edit these, and Markdown can be kind of inconsistent amongst things that use it. So it's a learning curve. 

## London, Day One ##

Right. So we made it to London within a reasonable amount of time, and I consumed enough wine en route to no longer feel twitchy about the effort it took to ensure that happened. We made our way to Border Control, and had to wait for approximently ever. We finally made our way up to the front, and I was as nervous as I always am around border control (somewhere between very and extremely, though I can't tell you _why_). We were staying at an Airbnb, and thank God I had taken a screenshot of the address, otherwise we would've been hosed. The border control looks at what we have written on our landing papers, then asks me to pull it up on my phone. I'm inching more toward outlandishly nervous at this point, when she says she wanted to check because that's where she lives. She then spent the rest of the mini interview instructing us how to get there. Which, you know, is significantly better than being detained. 

Immediately after border control, there are multiple vending machines that sell sim cards, so I'm sure you can guess the first place we stopped. We hemmed an hawed over which to go with, with Ryan choosing EE, and me choosing the more recognizable Three. We'll see who made the better choice when we jump to mainland Europe, but he gets wifi on the Tube, so right now he's coming out ahead. Then we took our nearly two hour tube journey across London, which was uneventful other than someone eating a ~~zucchini~~ courgette like a cob of corn. 

As we were walking into our Airbnb, we ran into one of our coworkers, Mihai, coming out of the building with his wife and daughter to attend the summer festival going on in the common space. While we were staying fairly close to the office, let's talk for a minute about the level of bizarre it takes to run into someone you know within hours of being in a city of 8.6 million. We made plans to chat later, and headed up to the flat where we're letting a room still kind of dumbfounded. Because London is expensive as all hell, we're playing roommates to a guy from Airbnb named Jack for the next two weeks. He's pretty pleasent, but as of today's writing (day five), this has been the only time we've seen him  -- we haven't been around much. We settled in, and were face down asleep within thirty minutes. 

After we -- somewhat begrudgingly -- woke up, we met up with Mihai and his family to try out a pizza place around the corner. They wound up having a concert on, so we decdided to go to the local pub. It was typically pub fare, but they did have a huge beer garden we hung out in, where I got to learn Mihai's daughter has been taught by his aunt to call squirrels the German equivelant of "hot chick." As great as just the concept of that is, watching her mother's reaction to it every time was even better. 

Following the pub, we went to meet up with one of my friends from Oxford, Laura, and her boyfriend, and another of our coworkers, Joan, and his girlfriend in Angel. We began our night out at a pub that served a decent amount of craft beers/ales/ciders, where I was reminded that holy shit, England serves those beverages warm. (Side note, the cider I got was called Pig Squeal. That's all, carry on.) I went to pay, and realized I did not retain my knowledge of which coin is which (I'm willing to bet the amount I somehow know about the kardashians took its place), so I got to look touristy as hell. We capped that off with me leaving a tip and Laura asking me what the hell I was doing. I awkwardly took it back, and we went to a table to catch up on the last six years. 

Joan and Adriana joined us around this time, and we took off to another pub that had cocktails and a 2am license. More accurately, the pub advertised cocktails -- but when we ordered off the menu, you would have thought we asked the bartenders to distill the liquor themselves. There was a lot of hunting on shelves and papers with recipes coming out, so we'll call that part two of looking touristy as hell. We sat and drank and talked about everything from Game of Thrones (I still haven't seen it, and am tempted not to out of sheer stubborness at this point) to Brexit (Bullshit.) to the US Presidential election (Seriously, what is even happening?), to what we should do in London in the upcoming weeks, until oh shit -- it's 3am. Hey, did you know London is getting a night tube? ....Three weeks from now. Uber it is, because Lord knows I am too jetlagged at this point to navigate the night bus. 

## London, Day Two ##

11:30am -- Alarm goes off. No.
12:30pm -- Alarm goes off. No.
1:30pm -- Alarm goes off. Oh shit, the guy we're staying with probably hates us. 
So at that point, we get out of bed and start getting ready to meet another coworker, Antonios, and his girlfriend. We meet at the Embankent station, which is unsurprisingly by the bank of the Thames, and eat at a restaurant called Giraffe, which is a decently large chain in the UK. I got "Tuk Tuk Duck Stir Fry," which honestly was pretty phenomenal, though I did have to salt it, because I am an American.

After that, we walked down to Tower Bridge. A pretty long walk, but Ryan got to start to get a sense of London. We stopped at a couple pubs along the way, and made our way through quite a few street festivals -- including one that involved drag queens singing Beauty and the Beast, which you KNOW caught my attention. (I basically had to be pryed away.) It was a nice walk, and a good opportunity to get to know Antonios and Tatiana.

We ended at The Dickens Inn, which was gorgeous and covered in flowers. Of course I'm a moron and took a Snapchat and forgot to save it. We grabbed a couple drinks there, and I poured over Yelp to try to figure out somewhere to eat. Guys, London is overwhelming when you're trying to sort out where to eat. Like... Ryan and I, much like every other couple in the world, already have a hard enough time with this in Lincoln. We settled on an Italian place, and headed there with Antonios, as Tatiana had to take off.

On the way, we passed a pub that Antonios had been to recently, where apparently they used to hang criminals while the tide was high, then kind of let the tide do their dirty work as it went out. Uh, I guess that puts Ricketts trying to illegally import drugs for lethal injection in perspective. (Just kidding. Ricketts is still basically Lex Luther but more stupid.) We got pizza and bruschetta, which wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about -- despite that being exactly what I'm doing. Apparently there might be something to the whole tipping thing in the U.S, because it took about twenty years to get our check, making it a fairly late night back home.
